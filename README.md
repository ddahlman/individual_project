# individual_project

this is an individual project which I made for school to begin with. 
It's become more of a resum√© where I show what I'm capable of for now.
The clientside is built with html, css, js and I've used jquery and bootsrap as frameworks/libraries. The serverside is built with PHP and DB is MySQL.
